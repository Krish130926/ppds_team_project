# ppds_team_project


Project Overview

In this assignment, you will create a product that combines programming and data science. Your project should be a useful and functional web application that combines data in novel ways with a Python backend, targeting a specific audience. The application must utilize data, transform it, and provide new value or enable novel interactions for users.

Project Requirements

Develop a data product with the following components:
Python backend (FastAPI)
Database for data storage (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MongoDB)
Data pipeline for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes
React/JavaScript frontend
Ensure the application is accessible to anyone with an internet connection and a web browser, without requiring any additional software installation or complex setup.

Implement data processing and transformation within your application:
Collect or source relevant data for your project
Process and analyze the data
Present insights or enable data-driven interactions through your application
Provide actionable insights or novel value to users based on the processed data.
Follow best practices for web development (templated for you)
Create clear documentation for both users and developers, including setup instructions and API documentation if applicable.

Project Timeline and Milestones

The project will span 9 weeks, divided into 2-week sprints:

Sprint 1 (Weeks 5-6):
Week 5: Lightning Presentations
Prepare a 3-minute pitch on your project idea and implementation plan.
Present your proposed architecture.
Week 6: Data Pipeline Prototype
Develop the basic ETL/C (Extract, Transform, Load/Capture) process to support your product.

Sprint 2 (Weeks 7-8): API Development
Create the basic API to support your data product (backend).

Sprint 3 (Weeks 9-10): Frontend v0 and Demo Day 1
Develop a basic frontend that interacts with your API.
Week 10: Present and demonstrate your initial data product.

Sprint 4 (Weeks 11-12): Deployment and Demo Day 2
Week 11: Deploy your application
Week 12: Demo Day 2, present and demonstrate your near-completed data product.

Final Week (Week 14):
Week 13/14: Final Project Demos

Grading Rubric

Team Grade (50% of total grade)

Technical Competence (25%)
Application functionality and reliability
Proper implementation of techniques/topics discussed in class
Code structure and adherence to best practices
Innovation (25%)
Originality of the idea (does this already exist? If so, how is what you’re making different/better?)
Quality and uniqueness of data used
Peer-ranking innovation score (demo days)
Demos / Working Data Product
Two peer-ranked demo days (12.5% each)
Clarity of presentation
Functionality of the product
User experience
Teamwork and Presentation (25%)
Quality and clarity of project documentation
Presentation delivery and preparedness

Individual Grade (50% of total grade)

Your individual grade will be based on your contribution to the project, as measured by:

Git commit history (code contribution is mandatory)
Individual contribution summary (submitted at the end of the project)
Jira task history
Observations by the instructor and TAs

Note: If all team members contribute equally, each will receive 100% for their contribution score.

Team Dynamics and Expectations
I Recognize that team members may have different skill levels in various areas.
Each team member is expected to contribute code and complete tasks, regardless of skill level. Scale your project’s scope to meet everyone equally (e.g., don’t race ahead and leave someone with less tech skills behind, take them with you).

Submission Guidelines

1. All code must be submitted via your designated Git repository here (PPDS Teams).
2. Maintain an up-to-date Jira board for task tracking.
3. Submit an individual contribution summary at the project's conclusion.
4. Prepare and deliver presentations for each demo day and the final project demonstration.

Good luck with your projects and have fun!
